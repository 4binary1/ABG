So you've been to a friend's house party and you had a blast playing a game where everyone was involved and had a blast. Or maybe it was a rainy day and you decided to dust off your copy of an old game you hadn't play since your childhood and ended up having a laugh with the whole family. It could even possibly be that an acquaintance showed you a surprising card game that you didn't know existed and you ended up playing for the whole afternoon while getting to know each other.

Whatever it was, something probably happened that made you wonder one of the following:

- what is a board game?
- what are board games up to nowadays?
- is there something else like what I just played?

If that's the case I think it's safe to say that you might be discovering an interest in boardgames and if that's the case you probably want some answers.

What is a board game?

"Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniature wargames or tile-based games." (Source Wikipedia)

Now that sounds generic...and in fairness, it is. I tend to use the term board game instead of tabletop game and you will find that a lot of people do to. Moreover, I would categorize as board games even games that don't require being played on a table or don't have a game board (e.g. a lot of party games).

To me, a board game is an experience with defined rules, a limited duration (at times a very long one) and that usually comes in a box. But you probably already knew that, didn't you?

What are board games up to nowadays?

You probably played some boardgame at some point or another in your life. Monopoly, Clue, Risiko, Guess Who...they all count. Even your regional card game could be considered a tabletop game. But today board gaming is a interestingly vast hobby with N new games being printed every year and some other big number to make the point. This might seem a lot to get into for a new hobby but don't worry, there are some good resources out there to help you start looking around (who knows, maybe this blog is one).

is there something else like what I just played?

Let's say you just played Carcassonne or Catan for the first time and you found it interesting. Now you would like to try something similar but with a little more pizazz. You open an online store and you type the name of the game you just played to look for related products...and you get submerged by a million games with review after review and different themes, art, rules. And perhaps you even start buying (I know I did). But wait, do you even know what you want from your games? Experience will definitely shape your tastes but why not going into it with somewhat of an idea already?

This is what this blog would like to be: a (unqualified) primer to the marvelous world of board games. It's what I would've liked to have had when first going into the hobby. Here I will post about game vocabulary, types, resources and everything you need to find out what YOU like so that you don't have to ask to your friend with a big collection which game you should buy now that you played Ticket to Ride once.
