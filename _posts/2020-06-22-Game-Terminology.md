So you decided that you might actually be into board games and you want to know what to look for. As I said in my previous entry (link) the best persone who can talk what you'll like to play is... You. But if you want to embark on the voyage to find your own true taste first you need to learn how to sail. And even before that you need to know the jargon (I have zero experience in sailing but we all know sailors use some very peculiar words). 

Once you start reading reviews, visiting BGG (which I talked about here - link), watching videos and listening to podcasts, you'll start coming across many words which are most times given for granted. This is actually one of the aspects of the hobby that pushed me to start this blog. I will post a number of entries dedicated to these words and the mechanics or game types they represent. But here I'd like to introduce you to 4 omnipresent terms that you might hear or read in the context of board games:

- Abstract games
- Euro games
- American-style games
- Party games
- Fillers

"An abstract strategy game is a strategy game in which the theme is not important to the experience of playing" (Source Wikipedia) . These games usually have no luck involved, perfect information (i.e. nothing is hidden form other players) and resemble a series of puzzles that the player pose to each other ([http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml](http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml)). This means that most classic or ancient board games would fall in this category, think Chess, Go or Checkers. Today there are however examples of games that do have non-deterministic elements (like dice or cards to be drawn) or hidden information but are still classified as abstract games (the Wikipedia page for abstract strategy games suggests a few examples). In general, when I read or hear someone defining a game as abstract, I assume that they mean a game in which the theme is very circumstantial and might be swapped with anything else without changing how the game feels. As we'll see in the next paragraph, eurogames tend to overcome that by trying to intertwine (most times) the theme with the rules themselves. Few examples of modern abstract games are Hive, Santorini or Onitama.

The term Euro game is probably the most outdated I'll be talking about today. Euro games are sometimes (rarely nowadays) called German-style games due to the country where they first were popularized in the 60's. It was in the 90's however, with the publication of Settlers of Catan, that this kind of games became popular outside of Europe, awarding the category its name. Euro game is often used as a catch-all term for games with indirect player interaction, no or few luck elements ,and simple themes, loosely coupled with the rules. However, most often games are put under this category when they rely on one of the following mechanics (source Wikipedia, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame)):

- Tile Placement
- Auctions
- Trading/Negotiation
- Set Collection
- Area Control
- Worker Placement or Role Selection

We'll get into the details of what each of these mean in future articles, for the moment it shoudl suffice you to know that when somebody calls a game a Euro it's often talking about a board game with abstract components (wooden cubes, meeples, card board tokens) and less conflict or thematic setting than an American-style game or wargame. A classic example of euro game (apart from the mentioned Settlers of Catan) is Agricola. In this game players are farmers that strive to grow crop, improve their homes and raise livestock better than their competitors. Although the theme could be considered dull and unrelated by most players, the available actions resonate better with the theme than, for instance, the movements of kings and queens do in chess.

It should be noted that nowadays games tend to have more interesting themes and highly value aesthetics which is making the definition of Euro games more and more difficult. Moreover, some definitions actually decouple heavily the theme and the rules, highlighting a dependency from mechanics ([https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame)). Other examples of modern Euro games are Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, The Voyages of Marco Polo, and Modern Art.

If you're into Podcasts, Ludology has a great GameTek episodes covering the origin and evolution of Euro games ([https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-188-eurogames](https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-188-eurogames)).

If we wanted to make it easy to understand what an Eurogame is, we could just say that it's a board game that it's neither abstract nor an American-style game. Amerigames originated, unsurprisingly, in the USA and feature direct interaction and conflict between the players, high thematic involvement and strong dependency on luck. An alternative term often used for this kind of games is Ameritrash, which I have personally heard used almost always with a positive connotation. Similarly to Euro games, the definition has grown looser over time and is usually used to contrast the former. Amerigames also often features miniature figures, or minis, that might be painted (and that's a whole world in itself). I personally have small experience with these types of games apart from classic examples like Diplomacy or Risk!, which heavily suffer the test of time and can be replaced with much more valid alternatives. Examples of modern Amerigames are Battlestar Galactica, Civilization, Cosmic Encounter, and Dune.

As with their counterpart, Ludology also has a great episode on Ameritrash ([https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-190-ameritrash](https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-190-ameritrash)) 

A small parenthesis is worth dedicating to wargames, games that simulate warfare realistically ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wargame)). These are among the older non-abstract board games and represent, from my experience, a niche inside the niche. I know very little about this large genre so if you think you might be interested I suggest to start from the BoardGameGeek definition ([https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1019/wargame](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1019/wargame)).

Finally, the word filler is one you are bound to hear often and one that may be of great interest for new people getting into the hobby. Fillers are game that, during a board game night or event, are usually played between main games or at the beginning/end of the evening. This means that people usually categorize as fillers games that take up to 30 minutes, require very little or no setup on the table and have easy to explain rules. Most card games, for instance, are usually put under this category. Once again, the definition is very loose and some even consider 60 minutes game as fillers. When I started in the hobby most of my collection was composed of fillers as I could only dedicate short periods of time to games or wanted to add variety to a game night. And honestly, I have found over the years a lot of fillers that are really interesting and fun and are able to fit a very interesting experience in small boxes and time windows. Few examples of some of my favorite filler games are Arboretum, Biblios, Sushi Go, Railroad Ink and Between two Cities.

Now you know some of the most popular terms used to quickly categorize games. If you're like me, you'll start from party games and the expand your collection to eurogames. But you might also immediately fall in love with the confrontation and thematic appeal of american-style games. Whatever it will be, you will know what people in the hobby are saying when they say they loved that filler you just played.
