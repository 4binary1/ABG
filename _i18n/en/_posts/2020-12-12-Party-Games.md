Parties: 2020 hasn't seen a lot of those. At the time I'm writing this post party is an almost obsolete word that mostly applies to looking at people's heads through a screen. But social gatherings were, are and will be extremely important. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that a very successful category of the board gaming hobby is represented by *Party Games*. 

"Party games are games that encourage social interaction. They generally have easy setups and simple rules, and they can accommodate large groups of people and play in a short amount of time" ([Source](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1030/party-game)).  
I think this definition perfectly sums up what I would consider a party game, although each of the three pillars is pretty malleable. The Victorian era has contributed a lot to the popularization of group games played indoors. These are called *parlour games*, due to the location where the British upper classes would play them, and a classic example is *Charades.*

Nowadays the market is flooded with party games, due to their accessibility and tipically reduced cost. In order to navigate modern party games I like to divide them into three categories:

- Team games
- Social deduction games
- Suggestion games

As far as I know, this separation is not part of the common board game lingo although, for instance, social deduction games represent a well defined category. Processing party games through these lenses, helps me understand the kind of experience that they want to create.

## Team games

As the name suggests, in team games players are divided into two or more groups that compete for victory. The most successful games that I can think of within this category are word games. These have gained a lot of traction in recent years probably due to the very reduced rulesets and the extremely clever design of the most famous examples. Three games, in my opinion, perfectly represent this category for modern board games.

[*Codenames*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames) is a game by Vlaada Chvátil that has become so popular in recent years that it has seen a plethora of re-implementations with different themes. In the game, a player from each team tries to hint words to their teammates by using only one word and one number, suggesting the topic and how many words from the 25 available are the correct answer. I've yet to see this game fail to entertain a large group of people and if you wanted to play online during these quarantine times, a free digital implementation for this game is available at [codenames.game](https://codenames.game/).

[*Decrypto*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/225694/decrypto) is another word deduction game, from Thomas Dagenais-Lespérance, where teams try to guess a numerical code related to a sequence of known words while, at the same time, trying to deduce the opponent team's words. It's a great game of cunning and silly clues.

[*Wavelength*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/262543/wavelength) is a recent release from designers Alex Hague, Justin Vickers, and Wolfgang Warsch. This game is all about teams trying to gauge where a clue lies on a scale between two opposite concepts. It might seem strange but finding out how "eating" ranks on a scale from "non essential" to "essential" in your friend's opinion is super fun.

## Social deduction games

In social deduction games players are assigned a secret identity, tipically belonging to a faction, and try to achieve some goals while deducing the other player's identities or allegiance. These games have become very popular thanks, especially, to games like *Werewolf* and *Mafia*. These are essentially the same game (the name depends on regionality or preferences) and require nothing more than the group of players. There are, however, some modern games that I'd like to highlight for this caregory.

[*Secret Hitler*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/188834/secret-hitler) by Mike Boxleiter, Tommy Maranges, and Max Temkin, sees players divided between fascists and liberals trying to pass laws for their own team while hiding their identity. Although nice, I find that this game suffers a bit too much from the luck of the draw, which makes for an interesting but very swingy experience. A digital implementation for this game is available for free on [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/secret-hitler).

[*The Resistance: Avalon*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/128882/resistance-avalon) from Don Eskridge reimplements *The Resistance* and adds a few interesting elements. While playing in a pretty similar way to *Secret Hitler* I feel that it removes some of the luck making it a more thinky and deductive game.

[*Two rooms and a boom*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/134352/two-rooms-and-boom), designed by Alan Gerding and Sean McCoy, deviates from the previous games in that it creates a much bigger experience. This game is often played at conventions where a large group of people is divided in two teams and a variety of roles communicate and plot to have or not have the president and the bomb in the same room at the end of the game.

## Suggestion games

Even though you might already be in the know when it comes to board games, you might be wondering what I mean by suggestion games. There's a lot of games that came out in the last ten years or so that revolve around the mechanisms of providing a suggestion or definition with the purpose of conveying and information to other players. While some of the games I mentioned for the team game section above fulfill this definition, the games that I categorize here remove the team component and make the games all vs all or cooperative.

[*Dixit*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit) was designed by Jean-Louis Roubira and is one of my favourite games. It was, by far, the game most responsible of getting me deep into the hobby. The marvelous illustrations from Marie Cardouat (in the base set) and the ingenious rules led me to research artists, game awards, mechanics, expansions and go down the rabbit hole of board games. In *Dixit*, one player per round provides a clue for one of the amazingly illustrated cards with the goal of letting someone, but not everyone, guess. The other players try to deceive the oppontents with cards that also fit the definition. In my experience, Dixit very rarely fails to amuse players.

[*Concept*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147151/concept) by Gaëtan Beaujannot and Alain Rivollet surprised me when I bought it without knowing much about it. If you know *Taboo* you already know half of the rules. In *Concept* though, you need to let somebody guess a word or phrase without talking. Instead you'll use coloured cubes and exclamation points to describe the concepts that make up the answer. Describing "Die Hard" as a movie with terrorists that airs on Christmas might easily be interpreted as a movie about waging war on Santa Claus. While points don't really matter, laughs are guaranteed. This game also has a very nice free digital implementation on [Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=concept).

[*Just One*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/254640/just-one) from Ludovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter is the most recent of these games and definitely one that has had a lot of success in the past couple of years. Differently than the previous mentions, this is a cooperative games where all players give clues to a single guesser about a word. To do that, they write a single word but if two clues match they are deleted before the guesser can see them. The cooperative element is beautifully implemented here, as you try to think like the group in order not to write like the group.

## Blurring the lines

You probably noticed that this classification is not so precise and there's some overlap even for the games I mentioned. The lines can get even more blurred as designers come up with new mechanisms and innovative ways of creating fun party games. 

[*Mysterium*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181304/mysterium), for instance, was designed by Oleksandr Nevskiy and Oleg Sidorenko, and might make you think of *Dixit*, in many ways. This is however a cooperative game were a player takes on the role of a ghost which tries to help the rest of the players, impersonating mediums, reconstruct their murder. This is done by providing beautifully illustrated cards in absolute silence in the hope that the mediums will be able to discuss and connect the dots on what this silent ghost is trying to convey.

[*Pictomania (Second Edition)*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/252526/pictomania-second-edition) is another great game designed by Vlaada Chvátil that gives a new spin to drawing games like *Pictionary*. In *Pictomania* players all draw and guess at the same time from a list of possible clues. Knowing that nobody else can have the same clue that you have, you are challenged in guessing other's people drawing as fast as possible while still making one for your clue that is understandable. Even though this game plays up to 6 it's a guaranteed laugh at a small party.

[*When I Dream*](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/198454/when-i-dream) from Chris Darsaklis, is another of those games that pleasantly surprised me when I bought it on a whim. As in many other examples before, in this game players give single word clues to a dreamer but each player might want them to guess correctly or incorrectly. It's up to the guesser to decide whom to trust. But the best part of this game is probably the end of the round, when the dreamer can try to earn extra points by stringing together all guessed words in a dream. Watching people struggle to remember the last three words they said is exhilarating and, in its simplicity, an ingenious design choice.

## The fun in party games

We saw what makes a party game and what are some notable example but why would you play one? Surely being at a party is already fun (even though the introvert in me would like to disagree), so why would I want to set rules to the experience? I think these games possess two aspects that make them perfect for social gatherings and even slightly separate them from other board games.

Party games are extremely welcoming to new players. As I mentioned here and in previous posts, these games played a major part in drawing me to the hobby, as they don't set an entry barrier. Most of the games that I mentioned can be played by literally anyone, regardless of age or experience. They create fun by mainly leveraging the players' personalities and creativity, removing the complexities of learning game mechanics. This also means that they can be played by experienced and new players at the same time without impacting either's enjoyment of the game itself.

And enjoying the game is actully the second strength of party games, as they put the focus on the experience itself. All games should be enjoyed regardless of the outcome but most of them rely on the players remaining in the *magic circle* and abiding to the rules, the most important of which often is that one should play to win. Lots of board games break if players cease to try to win but the focus that party games put on the experience is such that elation is caused by the activity rather than the outcome.

So whether you are a a new player approaching the hobby or an experienced gamer, I recommend no to overlook party games: the creativity of grandma's clue in *Dixit* might just surprise you.
