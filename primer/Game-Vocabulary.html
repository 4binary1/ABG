  <article>
    <p>So you decided that you might actually be into board games and you want to know what to look for. As I said in my <a href="/ABG/primer/Welcome-to-ABG.html">previous post</a>, the best person who can tell what you’ll like to play is <em>you</em>. But if you want to embark on the voyage to find your own true taste, first you need to learn how to sail. And even before that, you need to know the jargon (I have zero experience in sailing but I know sailors use some very peculiar words).</p>

<p>Once you start reading reviews, visiting BGG (which I introduced <a href="/ABG/primer/Board-Game-Geek.html">here</a>), watching videos and listening to podcasts, you’ll start coming across many words which most times are given for granted by the speaker. This is one of the aspects of the hobby that pushed me to start this blog. I will post a number of entries dedicated to these words and the mechanics or game types they represent. But here I’d like to introduce you to four omnipresent terms that you might hear or read in the context of board games:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Abstract</strong> games</li>
  <li><strong>Euro</strong> games</li>
  <li><strong>American-style</strong> games</li>
  <li><strong>Filler</strong> games</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="abstract-games">Abstract games</h2>
<p>“An abstract strategy game is a strategy game in which the theme is not important to the experience of playing” (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_strategy_game">Source</a>). These games usually have no luck involved, perfect information (i.e. nothing is hidden form other players) and resemble <a href="http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/DefiningtheAbstract.shtml">a series of puzzles that the player pose to each other</a>.  This means that most classic or ancient board games would fall in this category: think <em>Chess</em>, <em>Go</em> or <em>Checkers</em>. Today there are however examples of games that do have non-deterministic elements, like dice or cards to be drawn, or hidden information but are still classified as abstract games.</p>

<p>In general, when I read or hear someone defining a game as abstract, I assume that they mean a game in which the theme is very circumstantial and might be swapped with anything else without changing how the game feels. As we’ll see in the next paragraph, Euro games tend to overcome that by trying to intertwine (most times) the theme with the rules themselves. Few examples of modern abstract games are <em>Hive</em>, <em>Santorini</em>, <em>Onitama</em>, or <em>Blue Lagoon</em>.</p>

<h2 id="euro-games">Euro Games</h2>
<p>The term Euro game is probably the most outdated that I’ll be talking about today. Euro games are sometimes (rarely nowadays) called German-style games due to the country where they first were popularized in the 60’s. It was in the 90’s however, with the publication of <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, that this kind of games became popular outside of Europe, awarding the category its name.</p>

<p>Euro game is often used as a catch-all term for games with indirect player interaction, no or few luck elements, and simple themes, loosely coupled with the rules. However, most games are often put under this category when they rely on one of the following mechanisms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Tile Placement</li>
  <li>Auctions</li>
  <li>Trading and Negotiation</li>
  <li>Set Collection</li>
  <li>Area Control</li>
  <li>Worker Placement or Role Selection</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll get into the details of what each of these mean in future articles. For the moment it should suffice you to know that when somebody calls a game a Euro it’s often talking about a board game with abstract components (wooden cubes, meeples, card board tokens) and less conflict or thematic setting than an American-style game or a wargame.<br />
A classic example of euro game is <em>Agricola</em>. In this game, players are farmers that strive to grow crop, improve their homes and raise livestock better than their competitors. Although the theme could be considered dull and unrelatable by most players, the available actions resonate better with the theme than, for instance, the movements of kings and queens do in chess.</p>

<p>Nowadays games tend to have more interesting themes and value aesthetics highly, which is making the definition of Euro games more and more difficult. Moreover, some definitions actually decouple the theme from the rules, highlighting a <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Eurogame">higher dependency on game mechanics</a>. Other examples of modern Euro games are <em>Carcassonne</em>, <em>The Voyages of Marco Polo</em>, and <em>Modern Art</em>.</p>

<p>If you’re into Podcasts, Ludology has a great <a href="https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-188-eurogames">GameTek episode</a> covering the origin and evolution of Euro games.</p>

<h2 id="american-style-games">American-style games</h2>
<p>If we wanted to make it easy to understand what a Euro game is, we could just say that it’s a board game that it’s neither abstract nor an American-style game. Amerigames originated, unsurprisingly, in the USA and feature direct interaction and conflict between the players, high thematic involvement and strong dependency on luck. An alternative term, often used for this kind of games, is <em>Ameritrash</em>, which I have personally heard used almost always with a positive connotation.<br />
Similarly to Euro games, the definition has grown looser over time and is usually used to contrast the former. Amerigames often features miniature figures (or minis) that might be painted (and that’s a whole hobby in itself). I personally have small experience with these types of games apart from classic examples like <em>Diplomacy</em> or <em>Risk!</em>, which, in my opinion, suffer the test of time and can be replaced with much more valid alternatives. Examples of modern Amerigames are <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, <em>Civilization</em>, <em>Cosmic Encounter</em>, and <em>Dune</em>.</p>

<p>As with their counterpart, Ludology also has a great <a href="https://ludology.libsyn.com/gametek-classic-190-ameritrash">episode on Ameritrash</a>.</p>

<p>A small parenthesis is worth dedicating to wargames, games that simulate warfare realistically. These are among the oldest non-abstract board games and represent, from my experience, a niche inside the niche. I know very little about this genre so if you think you might be interested I suggest to start from the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamecategory/1019/wargame">BoardGameGeek definition</a>.</p>

<h2 id="filler-games">Filler games</h2>
<p>Finally, the word filler is one you are bound to hear often and one that may be of great interest for new people getting into the hobby. Fillers are games that, during a board game night or event, are usually played between main games or at its beginning or end. This means that people usually categorize as fillers games that take up to 30 minutes, require very little or no setup on the table and have easy to explain rules. Most card games, for instance, are usually put under this category.<br />
Once again, the definition is very loose and some would even consider 60 minutes games as fillers. Filler games that also have a high player count are also often called <em>party games</em>.</p>

<p>When I started in the hobby, most of my collection was composed of fillers as I could only dedicate short periods of time to games or wanted to add variety to a game night. And honestly, I have found over the years a lot of fillers that are really fun and are able to fit a very interesting experience in small boxes and time windows. Few examples of some of my favorite filler games are <em>Arboretum</em>, <em>Biblios</em>, <em>Sushi Go</em>, and <em>Railroad Ink</em>.</p>

<p>Now you know some of the most popular terms used to quickly categorize games. If you’re like me, you’ll start from party games and then expand your collection to Euro games. But you might also immediately fall in love with the confrontation and thematic appeal of american-style games. Whatever it will be, you will know what people mean when they say they loved the filler that you just played.</p>
