We are Michele and Sofia, two siblings from Italy who fell in love with board games and photography and wanted an excuse to practice writing and shooting pictures all while welcoming new people to the board game hobby.

Michele, known online as 4binary1, is a boy who found himself with software engineering job but never stopper playing. He's in love with games, both analog and digital and wants to play them as much as understand and develop them. But if there's one thing that he really can't stop doing it's blathering about things he (sort of) knows. 

Sofia was captured by the world of games primarily for their artistic component. Being a very creative person, she is often attracted by the plots behind the games as well as the innovative material elements. For this reason, she loves to photograph the smallest details that make each game more captivating and able to represent the story behind it.
