    <p>Whatever the season, you should always eat your vegetables. Like a good rich salad, with lettuce, tomatoes, carrots. The problem is: I don’t like salad! Lucky for me, I do love me some <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/274960/point-salad"><em>Point Salad</em></a>!</p>

<p><em>Point Salad</em> is a 2 to 6 player card game all about points by Molly Johnson, Robert Melvin, and Shawn Stankewich. Its name comes from a popular expression in board games, used to indicate games where every thing you do scores you point. This is usually used with a negative meaning. <em>Point Salad</em> takes this notion and turns it on its head, making it the pillar of the game and building fun on top of it.</p>

<p>The box comes with a deck of 108 unique cards and a rulebook. Each card represents one of six vegetables on one side and a unique scoring rule on the other. Players take turn picking cards to use them either as vegetables or for their scoring conditions. That’s it, it’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>“But where does the fun come from?”, you might be asking. Well before I played this game I didn’t know stealing an onion from other people could be so entertaining. The tears on their eyes as if you just sliced it in front of their faces. See, <em>Point Salad</em> is not just about building your collection of vegetables and scoring cards, it’s especially about preventing other players from doing the same. As in many drafting games, blocking opponents from accessing good cards is an integral part of the strategy and the great thing about this game is that <em>hate drafting</em>, as this practice is often called, almost always scores you point as well.</p>

<p>The quality of the cards is quite good, packaging is compact and portable, and the art is lovely. In its simplicity, the game looks very good on the table, with its vibrant colours and cartoony vibes.</p>

<p>The iconography for the scoring rules is super simple and self explanatory although some rules use plain text, which makes the game language dependent. This is easily overcome by explaining the card when it’s encountered, which will also clarify similar rules that apply to different vegetables. I played my Italian version with some English speaking friends and they had no trouble playing along.</p>

<p>By now, I played a number of drafting games and, despite the fact that it’s not one of my favourite mechanisms (I must say I’m also usually rubbish at them), I think <em>Point Salad</em> is a great introduction to the genre and to the hobby in general. The rules are super simple, everything is displayed on the table so no memory is required and the reward of every action is instantaneous. It feels great to take those two tomatoes that you were hoping for and it’s horrible to see that magnificent rule that matched your carrot collection get flipped and become inaccessible forever.</p>

<p>This game brings a quick and exhilarating experience to the table that makes for a perfect filler but can easily become the main course as you find yourself playing over and over again. So, next time you’re wondering what to have for dinner, you can’t go wrong with a nice <em>Point Salad</em>.</p>
